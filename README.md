# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
This is the beginning of my coding journey.
I have been a carpenter for most of my career but now see that I need to make a change.
My goal is to take the next year to study anything and everything about artificial intelligence in hopes of switching careers by the beginning of 2025.
